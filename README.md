# Introduction 
* This repository contains the community IP for 'Introduction to Infrastructure as Code using Bicep. 
* It is targeted at audiences who are new to Bicep and Infrastructure as Code (IaC)  - (though, prior ARM or Terraform experience would be beneficial as well)
* We'll be focusing more on core constructs of Bicep that are required to write well-structured and maintainable code.
* PPTs directory contains the decks and Labs directory contains instructions. Participants are expected to bring their own Azure Dev Environment. (or MSDN subscription)
    * Unless subscription passes can be arranged 

# Delivery Guide
The course is relatively self-explanatory and broken down into the following module structure: 
* Module 0: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Overview
* Module 1: Tooling with Visual Studio Code
* Module 2: Introduction to Bicep Templates
* Module 3: Build reusable Bicep templates by using parameters
* Module 4: Using Conditions and Loops in a Bicep Template
* Module 5: Using Modules in a Bicep Template
* Module 6: Collaborating with Git in Visual Studio Code (Optional/Time permitting)
  
Please refer to the Agenda.docx in the DataSheet folder for more delivery guidance and agenda.

For the Demos the folder Demos have the working demos for the relevant sections. For the Labs these are pretty straightforward and can follow the structure of the Demos but getting the students to complete the tasks.
